## How to Run the Source Code Locally

1. Download the zip file from github then extracted
2. Open android studio then select the open menu after that open the file that was extracted earlier
3. Wait until the gradle build process is complete, after that there are 2 options for running the program, using an emulator or real device
4. If using an emulator, open the virtual device and turn it on first, if so then just run the application
5. If using a real device, you can use wireless debugging or usb debugging as an intermediary for downloading the application, open the settings menu on android, then go to the developer option, turn on wireless debugging or usb debugging as needed, then just run theÂ application.
